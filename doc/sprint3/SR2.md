### **Unfinished tasks:**

IN-51 During preparing order status, add option to scan container to associate it with order

IN-52 Show how many impact points the user has received for each returned container


### **Practices to continue for the next sprint:**

We should continue to maintain the same amount of communication with each other. This includes standups as well as frequent Discord replies to each other. We also want to maintain the same commit and pull request template we used. We also want to maintain our detailed documentation, both in the code and in our documentation files. 


### **New practices to use for the next sprint:**

We want to bring the product manager into more of our meetings to better understand specifications and clarify concerns. We want to have some more in-person meetings to understand the team, the product manager and the product owner better.


### **Harmful practices to stop for the next sprint:**

A harmful practice we should stop doing is having many big user stories that lead to unfinished subtasks. To overcome this in the next sprint, we will communicate with our product manager and within ourselves to ensure each user story is of appropriate scope to make sure we can finish them by the end of the sprint. 


### **Best experience of Sprint 2:**

Our best experience was at the end when we pieced our application together and were able to see the different functionality working together. We were especially proud to demonstrate the functionality we implemented to our TA. 


### **Worst experience of Sprint 2:**

Our worst experience was just having two uncompleted user stories as we were unable to complete all the subtasks for them. The experience is mostly due to the many other courses that had overlapping assignments and midterms in the same time period.
