# Sprint 1 Retrospective Meeting


### **Participants:**

Longyu Li,

Sabih Sarowar,

Arthur Ng,

Rayhan Fazal,

Kevin Shin,

Raghav Sharma


### **Unfinished tasks:**

IN-42 Add option for restaurant to accept returned container


### **Practices to continue for the next sprint:**

We should continue to maintain the same amount of communication with each other. This includes standups as well as frequent Discord replies to each other. We also want to maintain the same commit and pull request template we used. 


### **New practices to use for the next sprint:**

We want to bring the product manager into more of our meetings to better understand specifications and clarify concerns. We also want to have more detailed documentation, both in the code and in our documentation files. 


### **Harmful practices to stop for the next sprint:**

A harmful practice we should stop doing is having similar subtasks that may have similar functionality. To overcome this in the next sprint, we will communicate with our product manager and within ourselves to ensure each subtask is clear and distinct. We will also refactor our design as needed.


### **Best experience of Sprint 1:**

Our best experience was at the end when we pieced our application together and were able to see the different functionality working together. We were especially proud to demonstrate the functionality we implemented to our TA. 


### **Worst experience of Sprint 1:**

Our worst experience was a member suddenly dropping near the end of the phase and us needing to take up some of his tasks such as documentation.
