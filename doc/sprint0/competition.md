## Competition
Inwit has only a few direct competitors as ordering online, sustainability, and climate action has only gained momentum in recent years. Most products that solve the problem of food packaging waste from restaurants are localized and would not in the short-term compete for Inwit's user base. 

The following are other products that allow users to order takeout or delivery from restaurants in reusable containers: 
DeliverZero https://instore.deliverzero.com/
GreenGrubBox https://www.greengrubbox.com/
GO Box https://goboxpdx.com/
barePack https://www.barepack.co/

Disregarding minor details such as the interface and container type, the main difference between our product is that it targets users from Toronto whereas the other apps currently only target users from, in the order listed above, New York City, Seattle, Oregon(mostly Portland) and Singapore. Functionality-wise, they are more or less the same. 

The other competitors may not have focused on the same users because every city/state/country has its own regulations. It is also common for products to only target one location at the beginning during its development phase in order to evaluate how a product will perform in the market. Only from there do services usually expand throughout the nation and globe. It is likely that if the competitors have gained success in their respective regions, they will eventually in the next few years expand their product to cover Toronto, which can have devastating effects on our product in the future. On the other hand, it is likely that in the short term, their success will bring awareness to the sustainability industry, and will in turn bring awareness to our product as well. 

Other competitors are food delivery apps in general such as Uber Eats, Doordash, SkipTheDishes, etc. Their users are people who order food due to time restrictions, travel restrictions, etc. Our product is better for users who want to help the environment because we reduce food packaging waste, whereas these apps mostly use single-use packaging. The reason competitors don't focus on these specific users is that they want to cater to a larger audience. Moreover, the logistics behind using reusable containers and returning them is more complicated than single-use ones. If there are a lot more people who want to help the environment, these competitors may focus on our users as well.
