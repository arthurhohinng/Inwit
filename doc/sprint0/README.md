# Inwit

Inwit is a zero waste takeout solution. It solves the problem of single use waste that other takeout services ignore. Inwit creates an environmentally friendly and sustainable takeout experience. Our goal is to normalize waste free services.

## Installation:
The Inwit team has provided us with an existing codebase. The frontend is built with
WordPress, the backend is built mostly with PHP and the database has been set up with
MySQL. The team will be able to build upon the existing codebase by pushing work
to a designated folder.
