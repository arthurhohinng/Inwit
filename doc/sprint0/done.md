A feature or user story will be considered "done" if it has commercial functionality, that is,
if the feature is usable by the targeted user(s) or present as intended in the final product.
The goal is for the final product to be immediately deployable.

Features considered "done" may be revisited after discussion with the Inwit team, if required.
