As Sprint 0 was mostly logistical, all team members had the same role of contributing ideas to the
initial planning phase and generating discussion. For future sprints, work will be divided equally
amongst each member at the start of each sprint. The team has decided to distribute tasks
together as a team instead of appointing a single member as the scrum master. Additionally,
each team member is responsible for reviewing the work done by the group and is expected to
actively contribute to group discussions.

Decisions were made through team discussion. The group first collected ideas on how to approach
a particular issue. Once enough ideas were collected, each idea was considered by the group.
If an idea was brought up outside a meeting, the team would agree to discuss the decision during
the next meeting. If a consensus was not reached after discussion, a majority vote was held to
finalize the decision. The team was able to reach a consensus for the majority of decisions and a
vote was only held once to determine the topic of the project.

As some features were already implemented, user stories were prioritized based on their existing
level of implementation. The team will prioritize unimplemented features first, incomplete features
second and work on improving implemented features last. Additionally, user stories will also be
prioritized based on the target users, with Users > Restaurant > Admin. The team has been given
full control on the priorities of user stories within each priority bracket and will hold brief
discussions on which user stories to choose from before each sprint. The team has also been
provided with a Google Document, in which user stories are color coded based on priority.
The document will be used in addition to any pre-existing tools to keep track of user story priorities.

Each meeting was held with a specific purpose and goal in mind, with the date and purpose of the
next meeting being agreed on at the end. Designated meeting times have been agreed on at 3 PM on
Sunday and at 5 PM on Monday, Wednesday and Friday on Zoom. Meetings are to be held within those
times as required, while the Sunday meeting is mandatory. Daily scrum meetings are to be held in
the Discord server and will consist of each member briefly explaining what they have accomplished
the day before and what their goals are for the day.

For the next phase, we hope to maintain the level of organization we have right now.
We will use the same approach we have established and used for Sprint 0 and make modifications
if necessary. We will also aim to establish a proper schedule for communication with the team at
Inwit and discuss methods of communicating to the Inwit team collectively as a group by the next
phase. Our main goal for the next phase is to efficiently and effectively divide the workload
within the team and implement all major architectural designs with the minimal amount of features
required for a presentable deliverable.
