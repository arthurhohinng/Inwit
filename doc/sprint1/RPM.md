# Release Plan Meeting
The release plan meeting took place on February 6 and all team members were present.
We went over the features wanted provided by the Product Owner and the user stories and decided that the required features must be implemented by release day.

## The required features include: 

As a customer, I’m able to create an account, quickly identify restaurants around me, and order food in desired restaurants. I am able to filter food by my dietary preferences. I am able to pay quickly and track my order to know when my order is accepted and when my food is ready for pickup. I receive Impact Points for every dollar spent on the platform and for returning containers. It is easy for me to know how many containers I have in my account and how long I have left to bring them back to any restaurant.
#
As a restaurant, I’m able to access my vendor site, to receive orders, accept them and set a preparation time as well as scan containers to the order.
