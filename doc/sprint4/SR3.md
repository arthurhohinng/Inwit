# Sprint 3 Retrospective Meeting


### **Participants:**

Longyu Li,

Sabih Sarowar,

Arthur Ng,

Rayhan Fazal,

Kevin Shin,

Raghav Sharma


### **Unfinished tasks:**

None 


### **Practices to continue for the next sprint:**

We should continue to maintain the same amount of communication with each other. This includes standups as well as frequent Discord replies to each other. We also want to maintain the same commit and pull request template we used. We also want to maintain our detailed documentation, both in the code and in our documentation files. 


### **New practices to use for the next sprint:**

We want to bring the product manager and owner into more of our meetings to better understand specifications and clarify concerns. We also want them to inform us of what remaining features are needed and where refinement is necessary.


### **Harmful practices to stop for the next sprint:**

A harmful practice we should stop doing is not completing subtasks in the critical path as soon as possible. For this sprint, we will try to prioritize the completion of those subtasks first to prevent other tasks from being blocked.


### **Best experience of Sprint 2:**

Our best experience was once again at the end when we pieced our application together and were able to see the different functionality working together. We were especially proud to demonstrate the functionality we implemented to our TA. 


### **Worst experience of Sprint 2:**

Our worst experience was when the product owner was sick on the day of our scheduled meetup. This meant we were not able to meet with her and use Inwit containers to test our container scanning.
